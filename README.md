# odin-recipes

# the current project were doing in pertaining to "top" is that were going to be building a website thats going to contain links to a few recipes   

# initially when i read the first few lines of this module, the end product popped in my head, i know most of this is going to be outlined for us but initially, what i was going to do
# was i was going to first: be making an index.html page, which was going to serve as the home page showing links for the recipes alongside pictures that would be inserted
# that would show what the recipe would make, the links whe clicked, would then take the user to a relatively linked page or another html file with some lorem ipsum text
# specifying ingredients needed alongside some pictures of the ingredients

# i havent went in depth into the instructions for this project so i dont know what wwre going to be displaying in terms of what weve learned
# but in this project i hope to display my ability to insert absolute and relative links correclty, alongside inserting absolute images.
