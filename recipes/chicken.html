            <em>Description:</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Starting off</strong> with this recipe, the <strong>first</strong> thing we're going to want to do is <em>collect some ingredients</em>. There are a <strong>multitude</strong> of ingredients that're <em>needed</em> for this recipe so <em>buckle up</em>. The <strong>first</strong> ingredient we're going to be <em>needing</em> is <strong>30 saltine crackers</strong>. The <em>reason</em> being is because we're going to <em>crush</em> them up and <em>add</em> them to a mix <strong>alongside</strong> some other ingredients that are going to be specified here, that're going to <strong>ultimately</strong> make up the <em>batter</em> for the chicken, and by us using the crackers it's going to give it that crispiness and the saltiness. The <strong>next</strong> ingredient we're going to be needing is <strong><em>2 tbsps of all-purpose flour</em></strong>, the reason being is because as i <em>specified</em> earlier it's going to be used ultimately as a <strong>batter</strong> for the chicken, and the reason we <em>incorporate</em> this is because it gives a lot of <strong>structure</strong> to the batter and its going to <em>hold</em> everything together. The <strong>third</strong> ingredient we're going to be needing is <strong>2 tbsps of dry potato flakes</strong>, the reason being is because it's going to give our <em>chicken</em> that <strong>crunch</strong>, mixed <em>alongside</em> the crackers, and its going to add a <em>variety</em> of flavors as well. The <strong>fourth</strong> ingredient we're going to be incorporating is <strong>1/2 tsp of ground black pepper</strong>. Just to give the chicken some <em>additonal</em> seasoning thats going to <em>greatly</em> enhance the the <strong>flavor</strong> with everything else its going to be mixed with. Coming down to the <em>last</em> ingredients, we're going to want to use an <strong>egg</strong>, just for some <em>structure</em> and so everything holds <em>nicely together</em>, alongside the <em>flavor</em> from the yolk. Second to last ingredient we're going to be needing is the <strong>chicken itself</strong>. specficially, <strong>6 skinless</strong>, <strong>boneless chicken breast halves</strong>. The reason we're <em>using</em> chicken breasts is because we're going to be able to <em>incorporate</em> the batter the most with how much <strong>surface area</strong> this type of chicken has, going to be able to get all up in the <em>nook and crannies</em>, and they're just <em>easier</em> in general to cook. The <strong>last</strong> thing we're going to be needing before we can start cooking is the <em>oil</em> of course, we're going to need <strong>2 cups</strong> of vegetable oil for <em>frying</em>, and the reason for needing so much is because we're going to be <em>frying</em> or the chicken is going to be <em>submerged</em> in oil while we cook till the <strong>golden brow, crispy, perfection</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, since we've <strong>assembled</strong> all the <em>necessary</em> ingredients for cooking, we're going to be able to <strong>put</strong> them <em>all</em> together and get this chicken <em>situated</em>. The <strong>first</strong> thing we're going to want to be doing as <em>specified</em> earlier, is making the <em>batter</em> for the chicken, so we can <strong>encase</strong> the chicken in the batter then <strong>fry</strong> it. You're going to first want to <em>place</em> the crackers in a <strong>large resealable plastic bag</strong>, and the <em>reason</em> we need a <strong>large</strong> bag is because we're going to want to be <em>crushing</em> the crackers and we want enough <em>space</em> in the bag so it can fit all <strong>30</strong> and we dont want bag to <strong>pop</strong> while crushing, once you've found a <strong>large</strong> enough bag, you're going to want to <em>seal</em> the bag taking <strong>most</strong> of the air out, then <em>laying</em> the bag <em>down</em> flat and <strong>crushing</strong> them till they're <strong>coarse crumbs</strong>. Once they're <em>coarse</em>, you're then going to want to <strong>add</strong> the <em>flour</em>, <em>potato flakes</em>, <em>seasoned salt</em>, and <em>pepper</em> to the bag and <strong>mix well</strong>. Another reason as to why you were going to want a <strong>large bag</strong> is because that's where our <em>batter mixture</em> was going to be <em>assembled</em>, and the piece of chicken when <em>encased</em> in the egg, was going to be <strong>inserted</strong> to apply the <em>batter</em>, Once you've added the <em>specified</em> ingredients to the bag, you're then going to want <strong>add</strong> the egg to a shallow bowl and <strong>beat</strong> or <strong>whisk</strong> it till everything <strong>combines</strong> together, and you're able to just see yellow for the <em>most part</em>. Once you've done that, you're going to want <em>encase</em> the chicken pieces, <strong>one by one</strong> in the egg wash, and then <em>insert</em> the egg riden chicken in the bag with the <em>batter</em>, and mix. Before you <em>mix</em> you're going to want to <strong>close</strong> the bag of course, but after that you're going to want to get as <strong>much</strong> batter as you can on the chicken <strong>shaking</strong> the bag. Once you've done that with <em>all</em> the pieces of chicken you're then <em>ready</em> to <strong>start frying</strong>. You're going to want to <strong>take</strong> those <strong>2 cups of oil</strong> specified earlier and add them into a <em>large</em> enough pan, once you've done that you're going to want to <strong>heat</strong> the oil to <strong>350 degrees fahrenheit</strong> or <strong>175 degrees celsius</strong>. Once the oil is that <em>hot</em> you're then going to want to add the <strong>entirety of the chicken</strong>, if you <em>want</em> so they can cook at the same time, or you can add them <em>one by one</em> and wait a bit longer. <strong>Regardless</strong> of what you do you're going to be looking for the <strong>same case</strong> in both, which is when the chicken is <strong>golden brown, and the juices run clear</strong>, which for the most part can <em>vary</em> from <strong>15 - 20 minutes</strong>. <em>Frequenlty turning</em> every now and then so it <em>cooks evenly</em>. After that you're going to be able to take the chicken out of the pan so it can <strong>cool down</strong> for a bit and you're ready to <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong>! As for <em>condiments</em> you're able to add a <em>variety</em> of what you'd like to eat alongside side but the chicken by itself is <strong>amazing</strong>.
