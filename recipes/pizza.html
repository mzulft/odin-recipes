        <p>
            <strong>Starting off</strong> this recipe we're going to have to <em>gather</em> some ingredients. First off we're going to need the most <strong>notable</strong> ingredient in this case for the recipe which we're creating, which is <strong>Yeast</strong>. The reason being is because active <em>dry yeast</em> is a <strong>leavening</strong> agent, which means it's the ingredient that <em>causes</em> the pizza dough to <strong>rise</strong>. The <strong>second</strong> ingredient we're going to be needing is <strong>Sugar</strong>. The reason sugar is <em>needed</em> is not only for flavor <strong>but</strong> also because to <strong>activate</strong> your yeast, you'll need to <em>dissolve</em> it in <em>warm</em> water with a <strong>teaspoon of sugar</strong>. The sugar gives the yeast <em>something</em> to eat and <strong>speeds</strong> up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is <em>active</em> when it becomes <strong>bubbly</strong> and frothy on top. The third ingredient which you're going to be needing is <strong>Bread Flour</strong>. So for most recipes you've probably heard that <strong>all-purpose flour</strong> was fine but in this specific case the reason we're <em>using</em> bread flour is because it is the <strong>ideal</strong> crust for <em>pizza crust</em> because it creates <strong>chewier</strong> results than <em>all-purpose flour</em>. This is because it contains <em>more</em> <strong>protein</strong>, which helps produce <em>lots</em> of gluten. Gluten is what <em>gives</em> the crust <strong>elasticity</strong>. Coming down do the last ingredients another we're going to need is, <strong>Olive Oil</strong>, and the reason being <em>isn't</em> simply only because of <strong>flavor</strong> but also because it <em>creates</em> a <em>barrier</em> between the oil and water. This oily barrier <strong>prevents</strong> sogginess. So it'll also give <em>longevity</em> to the crust as well. The last ingredient we're going to be needing is <strong>Salt</strong>, a <em>little</em> bit of salt <strong>goes</strong> a long way. Salt <em>adds flavor</em>, <strong>strengthens</strong> the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).

            Now that we've <strong>assembled</strong> all the ingredients needed for this recipe, we're going to be able to start <strong>crafting</strong> our pizza. The <em>first</em> thing, since we're going to be <em>assembling</em> this pizza from scratch, is going to be about <strong>rolling</strong> out pizza dough. Now this is the <strong>hard</strong> part for a lot of people, and that's <em>apparent</em> because stretching pizza dough is the most <strong>hands-on</strong> part of the pizza crust-making process. It takes a <em>little</em> practice, but it's as easy as pie <em>(pun intended)</em>. We're going to be over the <strong>steps</strong> so you can roll your dough out successfully, The first thing you're going to want to be doing after mixing your ingredients is: <em>allow</em> your dough to <em>rest</em> on the counter for about <strong>5 minutes</strong>. This will allow the gluten to <em>relax</em>, making the dough much <strong>easier</strong> to stretch and shape. After you've done that you're then going to want to <strong>prepare</strong> your surface with <em>oil</em>: You might feel inclined to <em>prep</em> your workspace with a big handful of flour to <strong>prevent</strong> sticking. This is a <em>helpful</em> step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, <em>too much</em> flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, <strong>rub</strong> your surface (and your hands) with a <em>few tablespoons</em> of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will <strong>prevent</strong> sticking, <em>encourage</em> a crispy texture, and <em>ensure</em> a gorgeous golden color. After you've done that the next thing you're going to be doing is <strong>shaping</strong> your dough: You have a <em>few</em> options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the <em>air</em>, use a <em>rolling pin</em>, or <em>pat</em> it with your hands. No matter which <em>method</em> you choose, make sure not to <strong>overwork</strong> the dough. Working it too much will create a <strong>tough</strong> texture. When you're done, you should have an <em>even</em> circle that's about <em>10 to 12</em> inches wide and about <em>1/3 inch thick</em>. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to <em>support</em> the sauce and toppings.After you've <strong>successfully</strong> done that you're then going to be able to start <strong>assembling</strong> the entirety of the pizza, so your choice of <strong>cheese</strong>, <strong>sauce</strong>, and the <strong>toppings</strong>. Lay out the sauce with your preferred, then put the cheese on top, and on top of the cheese you can lay ingredients out such as pepperoni, sausage, peppers, or whatever you'd like. This is your pizza, <em>you</em> can do what <em>you</em> want with it.
