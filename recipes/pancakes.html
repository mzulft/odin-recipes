            <em>Description:</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Starting off with the <em>recipe</em> for this <strong>delicious</strong> food, we need to <em>collect</em> a bit of ingredients. <strong><em>First off</em></strong>, we <strong>need</strong> flour. Im sure that was pretty <em>apparent</em> since we're making pancakes but if this is your <strong>first time</strong>, any all-purpose flour <em>regardless</em> of the name brand will work. <em>Next thing</em> we need is <strong>sugar</strong>. As for the flower, if youre not a <em>huge baker</em> thats the ingredient i would've expected most to <em>not</em> have, but as for sugar, its more <strong>commonly</strong> used so most should have that on standby. Any sugar will work but <strong><em>white granulated sugar</em></strong> is preferred. The reason being <em>granulated</em> and <strong>not</strong> powedered is because it <em>creates</em> a tender texture for the pancakes. Some other ingredients that're going to <strong>required</strong> are going to be: <strong>baking powder</strong>, any is <em>fine</em> and it gives the pancakes the <strong><em>fluffiness</em></strong>. <strong>Salt</strong>, <em>white preferably</em>, which adds <em>subtle depth</em> to sugar infused dishes. An <strong>egg</strong>, which is needed for <em>binding</em> to provide structure, also <em>adds</em> a lot of <strong>flavor</strong> as well with the yolk. <strong>Milk</strong> which is going to be used to <em>dissolve</em> some of the dry ingredients we mentioned earlier, also <strong>noting</strong> that it will provide flavor as well. Second to last ingredient which is needed, is going to be <strong>vegetable oil</strong>, the reason being is because its <strong>harder</strong> to burn than butter, and since were going to be <em>putting</em> the batter on the pan waiting for one side to cook, it keeps the pancakes moist and <em>prevents</em> pan sticking. <strong><em>The last</em></strong>, but certainly the most <strong>notable</strong> ingredient we're going to be utilizing, are the <strong>bananas</strong>. The base, and what <em>makes</em> banana pancakes, banana pancakes, are going to add <strong>so much</strong> flavor and texture to this dish, not even only in terms of flavor but in terms of the aesthetics as well. Those are <strong>all</strong> the ingredients which are going to be needed to <em>craft</em> this recipe. Now lets get onto how we're going to <em>infuse</em> all these together for the final <strong>result</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Starting off</em></strong>, we actually want to <em>combine</em> all the ingredients specified <em>earlier</em>, but <strong>not</strong> just in <strong>any</strong> order or all of them in a singular bowl, we actually want to <em>mix</em> some ingredients with <em>others</em> and vice versa. You're going to want to get a <em>dedicated bowl</em> for the <strong>dry ingredients</strong>, so ingredients <em>such as:</em> the flour, sugar, salt, and the baking powder. You're then going to want to <em>put</em> all the ingredients in that bowl and <strong>combine them</strong>. As for the <em>other</em> bowl, the ingredients you <em>didnt</em> use or the <strong>wet</strong> ingredients are the ones that're going to be going <em>inside</em> there, so ingredients <strong>such as:</strong> egg, milk, vegetable oil, and the mashed bananas. Once they're <em>inside</em> a bowl thats big enough to mix so the ingredients <em>dont splash</em> out when you're trying to mix, you're then gonna want to <em>mix</em> the ingredients in the wet bowl until they've all been <em>infused</em>, once you're done with that, if you <em>didn't mix</em> the dry ingredients before you're free to do it now. Once you've <em>mixed both</em> the <strong>dry</strong> and the <strong>wet</strong> bowl, youre going to want to add <em>all</em> the contents from the <em>dry bowl</em> to the <em>wet bowl</em>, so transfer it <strong>slowly</strong>, and once the <em>majority</em> is in you're going to now <em>mix</em> the <strong>wet bowl</strong> which should <em>contain</em> the contents of both the dry <strong>and</strong> the wet bowl. If after done mixing the mix is a <em>bit</em> lumpy thats <strong><em>OK</em></strong>, nothing was done wrong and we will proceed to the next step. Since we have our batter <em>prepared</em> the next step is going to be <strong>cooking</strong> and the <strong>creation</strong> of the pancakes. What you're going to want to do is, <em>pour</em> the batter in 1/4th cup <em>portions</em> onto a <strong>lightly</strong> oiled pan. If you have measuring cups that'd be <strong>advised</strong> but for the most part you'd be able to <em>eyeball</em> it. The heat should be on <strong>medium-high</strong> heat. We dont want the heat <em>too low</em> or it'll take <em>forever</em> to cook, and we dont want it <em>too high</em> because we potentially risk <strong><em>burning</em></strong> the pancakes, nice and slow. Cook one side for a <em>few minutes</em> then flip with a spatula, do the same for the other side then once both sides are <strong>golden brown</strong> or until your <strong>preferred crispiness</strong>, take the pancake <em>off</em> the pan and you've successfully <strong>crafted</strong> a banana pancake. Now from this point on its <em>good</em> to eat alone, or you can add your <em>preferred</em> toppings, such as <em>syrup</em> or additonal bananas on top of the pancake to eat <em>alongside</em>. Whatever you prefer, they're yours to <strong>enjoy</strong>, so good job on making it this far.
